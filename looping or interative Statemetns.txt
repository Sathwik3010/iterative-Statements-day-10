while
-----
if we don't know number of iterations then we should go for while loop

while(some action){
--------
--------
} 
is also known as top tested loop
semicolon is not mandatory
minimum number of execution are 0

do-while
---------
if at least one time is executing the do block then we should go for do while.
syntax
-------
do {
-------------
-------------
} while(some condition) ;
is also known as bottom tested loop
semicolon is mandatory
minimum number of execution are 1

for Loop
--------
if we know number of iterations then we should go with for Loop
Syntax
-------
for(initialization-section;condition-check;inc/dec section){
-------------------
-------------------
}

initialization section
-----------------------
this section will be executed only once in entire for loop representation.

jumping statements
-------------------
break;
the break statement is used to terminate the execution of loop or switch or label block.

we can use break statement in 3 places only such as
1. inside switch
2. inside loops
3. inside label blocks

if we are using any where else we are getting compile time error

continue;
----------
to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.
